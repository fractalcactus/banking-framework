# What is this?
Here is an account framework that a banking guru shared with me. It ensures that you prioritise paying your bills, actually stick to your budget, and track your cash flow. I hope this helps other people make a start on untangling this stuff! 

I bank with [KiwiBank](https://auth.kiwibank.nz/oauth/authorize?client_id=4uogpevo0xheiw5t0blubj4zwibte61&login_hint=guest&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.kiwibank.nz%2Fauth%2Fkiwi_connect%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=openid+email+profile&state=8c15dce365538b187e351a3b66ab3bd690777f7ee1eedb73), who have incredible service, and make it super easy to set up an account with them. 

They have two great features called [Sweep](https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/clever-stuff/sweep/) and [Paystream](https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/clever-stuff/paystream/) which take a lot of effort out of putting your money in the right places. 

# The Account Framework

### The 5 Accounts:

* SPENDING
* BILLS
* BUCKET
* CREDIT
* SAVINGS 
* TAX (if you pay your own tax)

For me, SPENDING is linked to an EFTPOS card, however this system works well with a Credit Card too .

### BILLS
BILLS is the FIRST PLACE money from income hits your accounts. It gets distributed to various other accounts after entering through here. 
BILLS is the account that splits the money across other accounts using [Paystream](https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/clever-stuff/paystream/). 
When a payment is made to BILLS, 50% goes to SAVINGS, 20% goes to TAX (if you're a contractor), and the remaining 30% stays in BILLS.
BILLS pays the Bills. Set up Automatic Payments to pay your rent/internet e.t.c from this account. 
Also, setup a weekly or fortnightly auto-transfer from BILLS to SPENDING. This figure is your weekly/fortnightly budget, what you want to have access to to spend.
This means that my EFTPOS card will actually decline if I go over budget, rather than me accidently spending what I intended to save.

### SPENDING
Spending is where you make your day to day purchases. Groceries, Dining, Socks e.t.c all come under spending. It is fed by BILLS, which has a weekly or fortnightly auto-transfer from BILLS to SPENDING. 

### BUCKET
Bucket is for people reimbursing you, so it doesn't get lost in your accounts. It makes it really obvious where the money is coming and going from. If there's money in your bucket then you know you need to do something with it.
*eg. I pay for 5 peoples tickets, $20 each on my credit card and mine as well, which costs $120 all up. 5 people repay me $20 and I transfer $20 from my spending account to bucket. Then I transfer the 120 from bucket on to the credit card in one payment, which matches the original purchase.*

### CREDIT
??? I don't understand this one

### SAVINGS
Savings is a high interest account, or other investment to keep your savings

### TAX
TAX ensures you have saved money for tax, if you're a contractor

### Sweeping
To make sure that your Bills are always the first priority, you can enable [Sweep](https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/clever-stuff/sweep/). "If your balance falls below your minimum, money is swept back from another account, so thereâ€™s always enough for your everyday expenses."
E.g Make sure that BILLS
